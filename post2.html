        <h2>Part 2: Financing your property</h2>
        <p><span class="emphasize">Financing your property, with low to no money down</span></p>
	    <p>If you don't work in finance, make sure you pay attention here. The financing details surrounding home ownership can be intimidating.  
            <br><br>It’s not like walking into the store, seeing a pricetag and making a purchase. 
            You need to understand interest rates and how they will impact your monthly payments, along with the down payment that you'll need to have ready at closing. 
            Shopping rates, the bank’s approval process, the endless documents to read through, and that feeling of "am I forgetting something?" can be a headache. 
            All that along with a hefty down payment can dissuade an ambitious homebuyer and leave them stuck in analysis paralysis, too caught up in combing through the smallest details instead of taking action.
            As a first-time homebuyer, I definitely felt some anxiety.</p><br>
        <p> I spent many hours researching the options that are available to first-time homebuyers and owner-occupants like myself, and tried to understand how to estimate the amount of money I would need at closing. 
            I didn't have a lot saved, and it was hard to understand what all would be needed aside from the down payment.
            Thankfully, I worked with a small bank that walked me through each step in the financing process and helped me understand what I was getting into. 
	        <br><br>First, understand that you don’t actually need 20% for a down-payment if you plan on living in the property that you’re buying. 20% is the rule-of-thumb for conventional loans, but first-time homebuyers can put as little as 0%-3.5% down depending on the loan type.
            Many people think that for a $200,000 house they will need to save at least $40,000 for the down payment, along with other closing costs. 
            That simply isn’t the case here. The main difference between paying 20% down or less is the private mortgage insurance requirement. 
            <br><br>If you put less than 20% down, you’ll likely be subject to this extra charge. 
            Private mortgage insurance insures the lender in the case that the mortgage holder defaults. 
            It’s paid by the mortgage holder and provides an incentive for lenders to be less risk-averse when making high loan-to-value transactions. 
            It isn’t too expensive, and is paid monthly along with your mortgage and homeowners insurance. 
            It’ll usually cost about 0.5%-1% of the purchase price of the home per year. 
            So for a $200,000 home, you could expect monthly payments of around $85-$170 depending on several variables.
            If you plan on paying less than 20% down, as mentioned in the previous section, be sure to include the monthly PMI cost in your financial statement when you analyze deals. To make it easy for you, the calculator on this website automatically applies PMI of 0.5% to your proforma if you have a down payment of less than 20%.
            It won’t make a substantial difference, but it will help you understand what you’ll need to actually live for free.</p>
	        <br><p>So we know that we don’t need to pay 20% down, now how do we get started?
		    <br><br><span class="emphasize">A step-by-step checklist for financing:</span>
			<br><br><span class="highlight emphasize">1. Decide which financing options to pursue</span>
				<br><br>If you’re looking specifically for the lowest down payment, ask your bank about these loan types:
					<br><br>VA Loan (Department of Veteran’s Affairs)
						<br>I’m aware that most reading this are probably not veterans, but this is worth mentioning as it’s one of the best first-time homebuyer mortgage products available. A VA loan allows veterans to purchase a home as an owner-occupant for 0% down payment and no private mortgage insurance.
					<br><br>FHA (Federal Housing Administration) Loan
						<br>This is a federally-backed mortgage product that allows home-buyers to close with a 3.5% down payment. It will require you to be an owner-occupant of the property for at least one calendar year, and you’ll also have to pay PMI. For reference, 3.5% down payment would only be $7,000 for that same $200,000 home instead of the previously quoted $40,000 down.
					<br><br>Low down-payment conventional loans
						<br>Different banks have different down-payment requirements and will underwrite mortgages differently. Many large banks have programs to assist first-time homebuyers. For example, Flagstar bank has a program that will assist students that have recently graduated and are entering the workforce by offering 0% down in certain circumstances. Some banks will offer an 80/20 mortgage, which is two different loans rolled into one to pay for the same property. One mortgage is for 80% of the home price, while the other mortgage is for 20% at a higher rate. These together allow you to pay $0 down.
                    <br><br>Ask your bank what’s available based on the criteria you’ve set. Let them know what you’re shopping for. The variables that you’ll need to cover are mortgage rate (the interest rate on the loan), the down-payment amount, other requirements like PMI, and closing costs.
                    <br><br>Also try to figure out how long they usually take to close on the product that you’re interested in. Some banks can close within 2-3 weeks while some can take as long as two months.
			<br><br><span class="highlight emphasize">2. Shop rates</span>
                <br><br>Many banks will give you a rate estimate, an idea of what to expect for a down payment percentage and closing costs online. 
                These rates aren’t what you’ll actually pay. There could be variance up or down, but they are generally good estimates to help you compare products.
                Then you’ll be able to talk to several mortgage providers to find the best deal based on what you’re looking for. 
                Check out the site calculator to get an idea as to how rates affect your cashflow. You can easily enter different rates and see how things change.
                <br><br>Also note the importance of closing costs. 
                Just because you are getting a loan with 3.5% down doesn’t mean that is all that you’ll have to pay upfront. 
                Closing costs account for all of the services involved in buying the home, from the inspection to the appraisal to the realtor’s fees. 
                Unlike down payments, these costs can be negotiated and sometimes you can negotiate for the seller to provide credit for them. 
                The standard cost falls around 2-5% of the purchase price.
			<br><br><span class="highlight emphasize">Get pre-qualified</span>
				Pre-qualification is just an estimate of how much you’ll be able to borrow. The bank will look at what you’re earning, what you have saved and your credit score to determine how much house they think you can afford. Some may use a simple formula based on your monthly income times a percentage that they have set - an acceptable debt-to-income ratio.
				Note that pre-qualification is just an estimate, and doesn’t guarantee that the bank will loan you that amount. It’s a quick point of reference that they provide, but it is also helpful to have to show sellers that you are serious.
			Get pre-approved.
				Pre-approval is different than pre-qualification in that it is the amount that the bank will actually loan you, not just an estimate. This takes longer and takes more into account, including a credit report. They also consider other debt that you have to service to better understand your financial situation. This is the best way to show sellers that you’re serious. It also helps to ensure that you can actually close a loan on a house that you get under contract. 
			Make an offer.
				Once you’re pre-approved and know that you can afford the property that you want, you are ready to make an offer. Discuss with your realtor and any other property experts that you may know to help. It is important to work with an experienced realtor that understands the property type and your goals. When I purchased my property, I worked with a realtor who is also a seasoned investor in my city and leads a real estate investing meetup group. He and I were aligned on exactly what I was looking to accomplish and he was able to give candid feedback on all of the properties that we scouted. When it came time to make an offer, he was extremely valuable in providing context that led to me making the right offer.
			Negotiate as needed.
				Once you’ve submitted your offer, the seller may counter. Sometimes the negotiation gets creative. Depending on the market conditions, you may have offered above or below asking price. You may have decided to ask for some money toward closing costs, money back for certain rehabilitation or renovations, who pays what to the realtor, etc. A counter offer is usually a good sign, because it means that you didn’t leave money on the table by offering too much to begin with. At this point, you’ll have to determine what terms you’re comfortable moving forward with. Consider the counter offer and decide what you would need to close the deal based on your own personal financial situation. Never lose sight of what you’ll be paying monthly and what you’ll be able to charge for rent. If the counter offer ends up leaving you paying a good portion of the mortgage yourself, it’d be smart to counter the counter offer to something that makes sense for you. If they don’t accept, it’s perfectly fine to walk away and find something else that works for you. Patience is the key.
			Offer accepted.
				If you’ve made it to this point, congratulations! You have a house under contract. There are many steps still left to complete, but you’re well on your way to living for free. We will cover the steps in detail in the next chapter, but there’s one important piece that I want to touch on up front as it is an important financial piece to note. 
				Earnest Money
					You’ll be expected to put down an earnest money deposit immediately after the offer is accepted. Usually this is about 1% of the total purchase price, I.e. $2,000 for a $200,000 home. Earnest money is the buyer putting skin in the game. Earnest money is held in Escrow until the property closes. Once the property closes, that money contributes directly toward the buyer’s down payment and closing costs. However, if the buyer withdraws, the earnest money is forfeited. There will be a clause in the contract that will outline what constitutes a forfeiture of earnest money, and when the buyer can back out without forfeiting the money. Just expect at this point that backing out will cost you your deposit unless something is uncovered during due-diligence that wasn’t addressed up front. 
				Backing out of the contract
					Once the offer has been accepted, you are expected to follow through and close on the home. However, there are a couple of situations where you’ll be able to break the contract without forfeiting your earnest money. One of the first items on the post-acceptance agenda will be a home inspection. A professional will be hired to inspect the home in detail and provide a full report including any items that may need maintenance or should be payed notice. If something turns up from the inspection that wasn’t called out before the offer was accepted, you will likely have the right to withdraw from the contract and have your earnest money returned. If for any reason the bank does not provide financing for the home or the loan cannot close, you are also likely to receive your earnest money back.
        Please note that once an offer is accepted, you are ethically responsible for closing on the home unless something turns up objectively wrong with the home that wasn’t originally foreseen. The seller has given you the right as a buyer to close on the home and you’ve gained exclusivity. Withdrawing from a contract is a decision that should never be taken lightly and should be avoided at all cost. Otherwise, you’ve stolen the opportunity from other interested buyers and have burdened the seller with a stressful situation.
